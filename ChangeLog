Version 12.11.23.1 ============== - Update code base to share most of the LMWT Plugin's Code. As a result all the features that   have been added in there since the last release of this plugin have now come along for free.   This includes Favourites and correspoding features (New item checks, labels), Recently   Watched, Watched Indicators, TheTVDB.com Meta Provider, easy support for multiple providers,   use of the newest version of the Plex Framework and a few other things. This also opens the    door for potential integration point between the two plugins and any other plugin that   eventually derives from this shared code base. As a result of this, the fully fledged    desktop clients loose the auto refreshing background meta retrieval that was used for    items listing.  - Added new providers: 180Upload, BillionUploads, 2Shared, Sharebees.    Version 12.02.26.1 ==============- Fix for RS Pro accounts. Now correctly logins and play video.- Added update notifier - When an update is made available a menu option will be shown at the  top level of the plugin. Selecting it will take you straight to the Unsupported App Store to  update.
